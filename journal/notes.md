- Implement a set of commands all the way through, persisting with a log that can be used for repopulating
  - CREATE TABLE
  - INSERT INTO TABLE
  - SELECT FROM TABLE
  - DELETE FROM TABLE
- Start with Scanning/lexing, use parsed commands to update in-memory representation, write successful command to log
